# Cats-vs-Dogs
A deep learning script based on the VGG model to classify between cats and dogs

To run this, first make a directory called nbs and then download the utils.py and vgg16.py and vgg16bn.py into that directory. Now also download the jupyter notebook into that directory. Make a subdirectory called data and then use the kaggle cli to download the data for the Cats-vs-Dogs-Redux competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/leaderboard "Kaggle data"). Run all the commands on the notebook and make sure to unzip the data.
